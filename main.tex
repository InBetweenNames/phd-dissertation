%TODO: separate into two sections
\begin{uwindefaultspaceenv}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Co-Authorship Declaration

			I hereby declare that this thesis incorporates material that is result of joint research undertaken under the supervision of Dr. Richard A. Frost.  The collaboration is covered
            in Chapters 2 through 6 of the dissertation.

            My involvement in the SpeechWeb project began in 2009 when I had begun my Undergraduate
            degree in Computer Science at the University of Windsor.  Back then, I worked with Dr. Frost as part of my Outstanding Scholars scholarship and became familiar with developing SpeechWeb applications in Haskell.

            Dr. Frost and Dr. Rahmatullah Hafiz had successfully shown in 2012 that it was possible to parse highly ambiguous left-recursive context-free grammars using functional combinators as part of Dr. Hafiz's doctoral dissertation. This opened the doors to a larger NSERC project
            that was intended to demonstrate that compositional semantics are an appropriate choice
            for building a Natural Language Query Interface to the Semantic Web.

            In 2014, although I wasn't formally credited, I helped contribute to a paper that was published at the ESWC \cite{frost2014demonstration}.


            In 2016, I completed my Master's degree with Dr. Frost as my supervisor.  My task was to extend the English coverage of the NLQI with prepositional phrases.  In doing so, I discovered that the word ``by'' as in ``discovered by'' could be treated in the same way as a preposition, simplifying the grammar and the semantics while also allowing more flexible queries.

            In 2017, I began my Doctoral studies aiming at bringing the SpeechWeb to the Semantic Web.
            This would require both improving the time complexity of query evaluation within the semantics, and also enhancing the query interface with an even broader coverage of English.  It would also require allowing the NLQI to run on a wide variety of devices, including those with low power requirements and using the semantics with non-event based triplestores.  Throughout the course of my studies, Dr. Frost and I published %TODO
            papers.  My contributions to those papers are as follows:



            %TODO explain:
            % * How I became involved in the project
            % * What Richard and Rahmatullah had done up until my involvement
            % * What my task was:
            %   * Speed up and extend English coverage (with prepositional phrases)
            % * Explain what Richard's NSERC was intended to achieve:
            %   * Speed up and prove compositionality is appropriate for building an NL interface to the Semantic Web
            % * Explain the different stages of the work
            % * Explain the papers we produced
            % * Explain my contributions to those papers
            % * State my thesis statement here and how the papers prove it
            % * Change formatting to be consistent across all papers
            % * Explain how the result of the work is more general, and the approach could be used to solve similar problems...
            % This is all to help the readers understand my contributions

%	Paper \cite{frosthafiz2008} (Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan) describes a set of functional parser combinators developed by Frost and Hafiz as part of Hafiz's doctoral thesis work, which enables language processors to be built as executable specifications of fully-general attribute grammars, including ambiguous left-recursive grammars.  The processors use a polynomial time complexity top-down parsing strategy which enables a natural specification of the grammars and the associated semantic rules.  This was previously thought to be impossible, and was stated as such in many textbooks on parsing.

%	Paper \cite{frostagboola2014} (Frost, Agboola, Matthews, and Donais) describes an event based semantics developed by Dr. Frost and his research team and includes extracts from a Haskell program which demonstrated the viability of the semantics with respect to an in-program database of triples coded as part of the program.

%	I'd like to thank, in no particular order:
%
%	TODO

%	Dr. Richard A. Frost, whom I've been working with since my first semester here at the University of Windsor, for his guidance in my work
%	and the many opportunities he has provided me over the years to participate in research.  You were the first professor I had a chance to have a conversation with when I started
%	my Undergraduate degree here in 2009, and ultimately it is our conversations during the labs of 60-100 that got me seriously interested in functional programming in the first place.

%	Dr. Robert D. Kent, for believing in me and providing me with many opportunities to contribute here at the University, and generally being a very positive role model in my life.
%	It is in no small part our talks that have allowed me to refocus, get my priorities straight, and get my life back in order.

	%My External and Internal Readers, Dr. Richard J. Caron and Dr. Luis G. Rueda, for being available on such short notice to participate on my Thesis Committee.

	%David MacMillan, Bryan St. Amour and Paul Preney, for being great lab partners, being up for interesting conversations, and always being willing to lend an ear.
	%Thank you also Bryan and Paul for letting me use your LaTeX styles and giving my first draft a read.

%	All of the secretaries in the School of Computer Science for their help during my degree.  Whether it was getting me through scheduling nightmares or helping me get things done by the deadlines, your help has been incredibly invaluable to me and I sincerely thank you for your work.
%
%	My wife, Taylor, for being incredibly supportive of me both in life and in my work.  It's crazy to think about all that's happened in the last 5 years.  I'm so grateful to have had you by my side through all of it.

Paper \cite{frost2014demonstration} (Frost, Donais, Matthews, Agboola, and Stewart) describes the demonstration of the Haskell program which I wrote and which forms the basis of this thesis work.  The reason that I am not listed as an author is that the paper was submitted before I officially joined the research team.  I developed the Haskell program after the paper was submitted.  The online program was the one used by Dr. Frost in the demonstration he gave at the conference this paper was presented at.

My contributions to the research project include:

%TODO: reword/shorten
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improving the efficiency of the programs which implement the event-based semantics
	\item Integrating the event-based semantics with the parser combinators to build the query processor
	\item Enhancing the existing module to access the external triplestore with efficient methods to do so, including a basic form of query fusion in the form of memoization
	\item Demonstrating a novel method of handling the word ``by'' in prepositional phrases, and extending prepositional phrases to span multiple property names
	\item Building a web interface to the query processor which includes both an English Natural Language Interface and also a safe Direct Query Interface for directly evaluating the combinators
	\item Converting the parser Hafiz wrote\cite{frosthafiz2008} to natively work with monads in Haskell, as well as the original semantics\cite{frost2014demonstration} to be monad based
	\item Maintaining the XSaiga package on {\em Hackage}\cite{XSaiga:2016}, an online repository of Haskell libraries and programs, which contains the semantics, parser, and triplestore described in this Thesis
