	%TODO
%	Paper \cite{frosthafiz2008} (Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan) describes a set of functional parser combinators developed by Frost and Hafiz as part of Hafiz's doctoral thesis work, which enables language processors to be built as executable specifications of fully-general attribute grammars, including ambiguous left-recursive grammars.  The processors use a polynomial time complexity top-down parsing strategy which enables a natural specification of the grammars and the associated semantic rules.  This was previously thought to be impossible, and was stated as such in many textbooks on parsing.

%	Paper \cite{frostagboola2014} (Frost, Agboola, Matthews, and Donais) describes an event based semantics developed by Dr. Frost and his research team and includes extracts from a Haskell program which demonstrated the viability of the semantics with respect to an in-program database of triples coded as part of the program.

%TODO

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging phenomenon in the public space.
Users with accessibility needs could especially benefit from these ``smart'' devices if they were able to interact with them through speech.  This thesis presents a Compositional Semantics and framework for developing extensible and expressive Natural Language Query Interfaces to the Semantic Web, addressing privacy and auditability needs in the process.  This could be particularly useful in healthcare or legal applications, where confidentiality of information is a key concern.

%	I'd like to thank, in no particular order:
%

%	Dr. Richard A. Frost, whom I've been working with since my first semester here at the University of Windsor, for his guidance in my work
%	and the many opportunities he has provided me over the years to participate in research.  You were the first professor I had a chance to have a conversation with when I started
%	my Undergraduate degree here in 2009, and ultimately it is our conversations during the labs of 60-100 that got me seriously interested in functional programming in the first place.

%	Dr. Robert D. Kent, for believing in me and providing me with many opportunities to contribute here at the University, and generally being a very positive role model in my life.
%	It is in no small part our talks that have allowed me to refocus, get my priorities straight, and get my life back in order.

	%My External and Internal Readers, Dr. Richard J. Caron and Dr. Luis G. Rueda, for being available on such short notice to participate on my Thesis Committee.

	%David MacMillan, Bryan St. Amour and Paul Preney, for being great lab partners, being up for interesting conversations, and always being willing to lend an ear.
	%Thank you also Bryan and Paul for letting me use your LaTeX styles and giving my first draft a read.

%	All of the secretaries in the School of Computer Science for their help during my degree.  Whether it was getting me through scheduling nightmares or helping me get things done by the deadlines, your help has been incredibly invaluable to me and I sincerely thank you for your work.
%
%	My wife, Taylor, for being incredibly supportive of me both in life and in my work.  It's crazy to think about all that's happened in the last 5 years.  I'm so grateful to have had you by my side through all of it.

\cite{frost2014demonstration} (Frost, Donais, Matthews, Agboola, and Stewart) describes the demonstration of the Haskell program which I wrote and which forms the basis of this thesis work.  The reason that I am not listed as an author is that the paper was submitted after I officially joined the research team and I was an undergraduate student at the time.  I developed the Haskell program after the paper was submitted.  The online program was the one used by Dr. Frost in the demonstration he gave at the conference this paper was presented at.

My contributions to the research project included:

%TODO: reword/shorten
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improving the efficiency of the programs which implement the event-based semantics
	\item Integrating the event-based semantics with the parser combinators to build the query processor
	\item Enhancing the existing module to access the external triplestore with efficient methods to do so, including a basic form of query fusion in the form of memoization
	\item Demonstrating a novel method of handling the word ``by'' in prepositional phrases, and extending prepositional phrases to span multiple property names
	\item Building a web interface to the query processor which includes both an English Natural Language Interface and also a safe Direct Query Interface for directly evaluating the combinators
	\item Converting the parser Hafiz wrote\cite{frosthafiz2008} to natively work with monads in Haskell, as well as the original semantics\cite{frost2014demonstration} to be monad based
	\item Maintaining the XSaiga package on {\em Hackage}\cite{xsaiga}, an online repository of Haskell libraries and programs, which contains the semantics, parser, and triplestore described in this Thesis

\cite {donais2013system} describes results of my Undergraduate thesis that I worked on with my colleagues under Dr. Richard Frost.  Although I had some experience with NL applications, I had none with Machine Learning (ML) approaches at the time.  Through this project I learned about Bayesian classifiers and I was able to broaden my understanding of the NLP domain.

\cite {peelar2017windsor,peelar2018toolpath,peelar2019real} describes work I undertook as part of an OCE TalentEdge Internship grant for developing a simulator for Additive Manufacturing (AM) parts.  I undertook this work in part to learn about High Performance Computing applications seeking to better scale the semantics presented in this dissertation for extremely large triplestores on the Semantic Web.  Although the work focuses on Engineering applications, many of the heterogeneous programming principles apply.
