\section{Thesis Statement}

This dissertation contains four papers that address...

It proves the following statement:

\textit{``A scalable, efficient, expressive and precise method for processing natural-language queries to the Semantic Web can be built using a Compositional Semantics.''}

The rest of this introduction will introduce the papers...

Please see \Cref{appendix} for a list of all papers related to this Thesis that I authored or co-authored. \cite{peelar2016accommodating}
