%INTRODUCTION:

\section{Motivation}

%TODO: Add more here?  Tie in Semantic Web with Natural Language, and talk about how NLP interfaces could be used to control IoT devices

% * State that Eric Matthews thanked me for helping him with his Thesis
% * State number of citations for each paper
% * Move acronyms to a separate page in the Thesis (NLQI, MS, ML, etc)

\section{Thesis Statement}

This dissertation contains four papers that address...

It proves the following statement:

\textit{``A scalable, efficient, expressive and precise method for processing natural-language queries to the Semantic Web can be built using a Compositional Semantics.''}

The rest of this introduction will introduce the papers...

%TODO
Please see \Cref{appendix:b} for a list of all papers related to this Thesis that I authored or co-authored. \cite{peelar2016accommodating}

\section{Proof of Concept}

%TODO
Rather than prove the thesis statement mathematically, I have chosen to build an interface that
proves that the thesis is correct.

\section{Structure of Dissertation}

The remainder of this Dissertation is structured as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item An Extensible Natural-Language Query Interface to an Event-Based Semantic Web Triplestore
	\item A New Data Structure for Processing Natural Language Database Queries
	\item A Compositional Semantics for a Wide-coverage Natural-Language Query Interface to a Semantic Web Triplestore
	\item Submitted: A New Approach for Processing Natural-Language Queries to Semantic Web Triplestores (Journal)
    \item Submitted: Accommodating Negation in an Efficient Event-Based Natural Language Query Interface to the Semantic Web (WEBIST 2020)
\end{enumerate}
